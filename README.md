# Smart Energy Optimization for Educational Buildings using Machine Learning

This project explores how machine learning can optimize energy usage and reduce electricity costs in educational institutions. The implementation was done for the IEM Management House (G+9 building) located in Sector V, Kolkata.

### 📌 Objective
To forecast power consumption using ML techniques and optimize it by integrating solar energy data and occupancy trends.

### 🔍 Project Summary
- Collected 1+ year of historical data including energy usage, weather conditions, and occupancy.
- Used LSTM and CNN hybrid models for load forecasting.
- Achieved:
  - 🔹 34% reduction in energy usage
  - 🔹 38% reduction in power cost
- Accuracy Metrics:
  - MAE: 12.4 kWh
  - RMSE: 18.7 kWh
  - MAPE: 3.2%

### ⚡ Key Features
- Load prediction using deep learning (LSTM + CNN)
- Feature integration: Weather, calendar, and occupancy patterns
- Simulated solar energy integration
- Focus on sustainable and smart grid applications


> 📌 Note: Final model code (LSTM + CNN) will be added.
